We have the following:

[X] Attributes
[X] Batch setting attributes
[X] Attribute quoting
[X] Properties
[ ] Typecasting for properties
[ ] Properties without explicit types
[ ] Validations
[ ] Get find_one working
[ ] Primary keys
[ ] Create/update
[ ] Events/hooks/filters
[ ] STI
[ ] has_many/belongs_to
[ ] acts_as_list
[ ] acts_as_tree

interesting problems:
 - add serialize type for attribute
 - properties/attributes still need a bit of thought
 - need a way of creating new property types (or maybe something simple like capital letter for class)
 - serialization contract for objects (e.g. money/date/address)
 - belongs_to is going to need to be able to override a setter for its associated _id method


Once we have this all done, let's go for a public release (that and BasePHP)
